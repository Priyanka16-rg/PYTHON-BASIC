    "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a class (known as a child class or subclass) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (referred to as a parent class, superclass, or base class).

In Python, if you define multiple methods with the same name, the last definition will override the previous ones.\n",

This allows for the creation of complex class hierarchies and the reuse of code across different parts of an application. When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains all the attributes and methods of those parent classes. If there are methods with the same name in multiple parent classes, the method from the class listed first in the inheritance list of the child class will be used.\n"

    "\n",
    "Ans- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class within a child class. It is particularly useful in the context of inheritance, allowing a subclass to extend or modify the behavior of its superclass while still leveraging the superclass's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Benefits and Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Overriding and Extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "super() enables a subclass to override a method of its superclass and then call the original method from within the overridden version. This allows for extending the functionality of the inherited method without completely replacing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization of Parent Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a subclass has its own __init__ method, super() is used to call the __init__ method of the parent class, ensuring that the parent class's attributes are properly initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Explicit Referencing:\n",
    "\n",
    "super() avoids the need to explicitly name the parent class, making the code more maintainable and adaptable to changes in the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance scenarios, super() ensures that methods are called in the correct order, following the method resolution order (MRO) defined by the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "The super() function returns a proxy object that represents the parent class. Methods can then be called on this proxy object, which will be dispatched to the appropriate method in the parent class based on the MRO.\n",

This allows for specialized behavior in subclasses while maintaining a common interface.\n",
